For my Javascript project, I wanted to do something different from all the labs in the section, and make a game. Making a simple game was something I always wanted to do, and I knew Javascript was a powerful language that would allow me to do just that.

Brainstorming the idea of the game didn't take very long. I recalled playing a typing game a long time ago that I found pretty enjoyable, and I wanted to recreate it; at least in concept. The concept is simple; letters will fall down the game screen (like Tetris blocks) and the player will have to type the letter before it falls off the screen. If a letter does fall off the screen, the game ends (there are no second chances). My original plan was for the letters to appear more frequently and fall faster as time passed (this will change and I'll come back to this later). Right off the bat, I knew there was going to be a challenge because my idea involved animation of some sort, which is not a topic covered in the cirriculum. I figured I would just build out my backend first and I'll research on how to do animation when I got to actually coding the game itself.
