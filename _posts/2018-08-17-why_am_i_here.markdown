Welcome to my blog. Here I will be sharing my journey through Flatiron School’s online full stack web development program. I will be posting about random things that I find interesting or things that boggled my mind and warrant further exploration. 

The first thing I should elaborate on is, why am I here? Well, after spending 3 years in the accounting profession (even longer if you count my college years), I became disillusioned by my career choice. While I was never a fan of the subject in college, I had decent grades and I thought that I would be okay with doing it for the rest of my life. After all, accounting is a stable, well-paying career. I figured I could just grind it out at work, then do whatever I wanted on my leisure time. But I found that as each year passed, I became more and more disinterested with my work and I began questioning whether or not I could spend the majority of my life doing it. So, after some soul searching I said “peace out” to accounting and here I am.

Why did I decide to code? In my soul searching, I looked back on my life to see what things I really enjoyed, and one of them is DIY projects. I really like making things from scratch, and tweaking things until I get it just the way I want. The end result is extremely rewarding because it’s something I created using my own ideas and methodology. And that’s what drew me to programming. As a developer, you start with an idea and then you create it. Even now as I’m just solving labs in the coursework, I feel a sense of accomplishment that I never felt when I completed a tax return or reconciled a balance sheet. The code I write is like my baby, and when everything works the way I want it to, I feel like a proud parent.

It took me a while to get here, and I’ve only just taken my first steps in the larger world of programming, but I’m having fun and I’m eager to learn. If you’re reading this, thanks for putting up with my rambling, and hopefully my future posts will be more insightful.
