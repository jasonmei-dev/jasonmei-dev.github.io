As I’m wrapping up loose ends on my graduation dashboard (this post being one of them), I find myself reflecting on my time spent at Flatiron. My journey through the online course has been a long one, riddled with setbacks due to self doubt and lapses in motivation because I would get down on myself, especially when I reached one of the projects.

Every time I started a project, I kept falling into the trap mindset that my project needed to be jaw-droppingly awesome. I would spend hours thinking of what features I could add to the project to make it stand out, oftentimes getting in over my head, and ultimately scaling it back down and feeling disappointed in myself for not being able to fully realize my “vision”. I understood the principles of project scoping and a MVP (minimum viable product), but my stubbornness kept getting in the way. Letting go and being okay with the fact that I was delivering a project that wasn’t perfect, but met the requirements was hard.

I was finally able to start letting go once I started attending the weekly React project study groups. I rarely attended study groups in my time at Flatiron, and I actually didn’t attend a single project study group for my Javascript project. Why did I suddenly change for this final project? Honestly, I don’t even know. I guess it was because I was fed up with being in another rabbit hole and I needed to get out of it. What surprised me though, were the reactions to my project from other students. One student said I “went above and beyond” on the project, and another student actually Slacked me after one of the study groups to tell me that my project “looks so awesome”. This might seem silly, but those two instances really got me to take a step back and think, “huh, maybe my project isn’t that bad”, and I was able to start accepting that things didn’t need to be perfect to be good.

In retrospect, I don't even know why I was so hung up on things being "perfect". There will be plenty of time to go back to my projects post-graduation to fix them up and truly realize my "vision". Programming is always evolving anyway, so really, there is no "perfect". Going through Flatiron's online web development course has opened my eyes to things about myself I was probably already aware of, but I brushed off as unimportant. Learning to let go and finding a balance between perfection and practicality is a lesson I will carry with me going forward.
